# Face Recognition Attendance System

# Introduction

> The project is about Face recognition based Attendance System. 
> By using this system, attendance can be taken simply facing the camera. This system has the ability to detect any face and based on training data. It can recognize and register the attendance for that student.
> It is very simple and easy way to take attendance in any class using this system. It is a very secure and accurate system.

# Challenges 
> Though the system claims to be accurate, it had to go through some challenges to achieve that accuracy. The most frequent ones were the change of environment during taking the photos, requiring adjustments to the algorithm. Another challenge was creating a CSV file and inputting data into it directly from the code for recording the attendances. There are still some difficulties in the system, but it is certain that the remaining challenges can be overcome.
